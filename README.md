## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to create a plan to move to Hawaii and start a business. The plan is to start a Surf and Shake shop that will serve surfboards and ice cream to customers. This plan will require an investor to develop a solid business plan. W.Avy who is known for his love for surfing and became the perfect investor. W. Avy had a past business which ultimately closed down due to weather conditions. W. Avy requested help with running some analytics from weather data he collected on every island in Hawaii. After analyzing the data, it was discovered that Oahu would be the best place to start a business. W. Avy wanted to know if the surf and ice cream business would be sustainable year-round.

### Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables.
The analysis required looking at the Oahu year-round weather based on temperature and check the percipitation during those months also. This required the use of Python, Pandas, and SQLite/SQLAlchemy to analyze the data.

#### Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

The temperatures in Hawaii in June and December are similar and will be great for surfers. We could also query for precipitation to understand the weather better.
A second query could be to consider the maximum temperatures each month to understand distribution of high temperatures.
